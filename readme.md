## Programming
Software, libraries and frameworks for development purposes.

### Python

- [Nengo](https://github.com/nengo/nengo) - Library for creating and simulating large-scale brain models.
- [Nitime](https://github.com/nipy/nitime) - Timeseries analysis for neuroscience data.
- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) - Community-driven software for processing time-resolved neural signals including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).
- [NiBabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) - Provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats.
- [PsychoPy](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy) - Package for running psychology and neuroscience experiments. It allows for creating psychology stimuli in Python.
- [NuPic](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) - Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing is an implementation of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a theory of intelligence based strictly on the neuroscience of the neocortex.
- [Brian2](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) - A free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks
- [expyriment](https://github.com/expyriment/expyriment) - Platform-independent lightweight Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and neuroimaging experiments.

### Matlab

- [FieldTrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) - Toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis.
- [Psychtoolbox-3](http://psychtoolbox.org/) -  Free set of Matlab and GNU Octave functions for vision and neuroscience research.

## Resources
Interesting resources related to neuroscience.

### Blogs

- [Neuroskeptic](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/) - [Discover magazine](http://discovermagazine.com/)'s neuroscience blog which offers a look at the latest developments in neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology through a critical lens.
- [The Neurocritic](http://neurocritic.blogspot.in/) - Often critical takes on the most sensationalistic recent findings in Human Brain Imaging, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Psychopharmacology.
- [The scicurious brain](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/) - A [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/) blog typically covering one research paper in a single entry.
- [Action Potential](http://blogs.nature.com/actionpotential) - A forum operated by neuroscience editors at the journal, Nature.

### MOOCs

- [The Fundamentals of Neuroscience | Harvard & edX](https://www.mcb80x.org/) - This course serves an introductory survery of topics in neuroscience and has no specific prerequisites, though some prior exposure to biology and/or chemistry can be helpful.
- [Introduction to Neuroscience | MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-01-introduction-to-neuroscience-fall-2007/) - Introduction to the mammalian nervous system, with emphasis on the structure and function of the human brain.
- [Computational Neuroscience | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience) - This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function.
- [Medical Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience) - This course explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system, while providing a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior.

### Newsletters
- [On The Brain](http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/hmni-newsletter) - Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute's quarterly e-newsletter.

### Miscellaneous
- [neuroSummerSchools](https://github.com/PhABC/neuroSummerSchools) - List of summer (and seasonnal) summer schools in neuroscience and related fields.
